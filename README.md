> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Crucial Concept to Understand Before Using:**
> This tool is specifically designed to **limit and manage** your server's bandwidth to save costs and prevent network abuse.
> * ❌ **It CANNOT increase your overall speed:** If your ISP or Hosting Provider gives you a maximum server speed of 200 Mbps, this tool **cannot** magically boost it to 400 Mbps.
> * ✅ **It CAN throttle/limit your speed:** You can easily restrict your 200 Mbps connection down to 100 Mbps, 50 Mbps, or any exact rate you prefer.

## 🌟 What is this tool?
VPS Speed Limit Manager is a powerful, lightweight, and interactive Command Line Interface (CLI) dashboard. It allows server administrators to seamlessly control network interfaces, throttle traffic, and monitor real-time data consumption without needing complex networking knowledge.

---

## ✨ Advanced Features Breakdown

Here is a detailed look at what you can do with this dashboard:

* 🎛️ **Custom Speed Throttling (Inbound & Outbound):**
  Set precise limits for your **Upload** and **Download** speeds independently. Want to restrict downloads to 10 Mbps but keep uploads at 50 Mbps? You can do it instantly from the menu.
* 📊 **Live Bandwidth Monitor:**
  Watch your server's real-time network usage. The tool calculates exact RX (Receive/Download) and TX (Transmit/Upload) data passing through your active interface in real-time.
* ⚙️ **Hardware Optimization (GRO/TSO Management):**
  Automatically configures Generic Receive Offload (GRO) and TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO) when applying limits. This ensures your traffic shaping works flawlessly without hardware bottlenecks.
* ⚡ **Integrated Speedtest & Ping Diagnostics:**
  No need to install separate heavy tools. Run Ookla Speedtest and check connection latency (Ping) to major global servers (Cloudflare, Google, GitHub) directly from the dashboard.
* 🛡️ **Persistent Rules (Auto-Crontab):**
  Your speed limits are safe! The script automatically saves your rules to the server's startup routine. Even if your VPS restarts or reboots, the limits will be re-applied automatically.
* ♻️ **One-Click Reset & Uninstall:**
  Instantly flush all network rules, delete crontab entries, and restore the server to its default maximum speed with a single click.

## 🛠️ Complete Installation Guide

Follow these steps one by one to install the manager on your server. Copy each command box separately and run it in your terminal.

### Step 1: Update Server Packages
Highly recommended if you are using a fresh server. This updates your server's package list and upgrades existing packages.
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Step 2: Download the Installer
This command will securely download the core installer script from this repository to your server.
```bash
wget -O /root/clp.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yeasinulhoquetuhin/VPS-SPEED-LIMIT-MANAGER/refs/heads/master/install.sh
```

### Step 3: Grant Execution Permissions
You need to give the downloaded file permission to run as a program.
```bash
chmod +x /root/clp.sh
```

### Step 4: Run the Setup
This executes the script to set up the environment, install network dependencies (`tc`, `ethtool`), and create the core files.
```bash
sudo bash /root/clp.sh
```

### Step 5: Reload Terminal Profile
This applies the newly created dashboard shortcut to your current terminal session immediately.
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 💠 ʜᴏᴡ ᴛᴏ ᴏᴩᴇʀᴀᴛᴇ ᴛʜᴇ ᴅᴀꜱʜʙᴏᴀʀᴅ?

Once the installation is complete, you no longer need to type long commands or locate script files. The installer creates a permanent shortcut on your server.

Simply type the following command anywhere in your terminal and hit **Enter**:

```bash
clp
```

**Navigating the Menu:**
When the dashboard opens, you will see a beautifully designed menu with numbers `[0-9]`. Just type the number of the action you want to perform (e.g., type `1` to set custom limits, type `3` to open the live monitor) and press Enter. Enjoy full control over your network!
